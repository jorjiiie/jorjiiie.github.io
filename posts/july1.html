				<p>
					It's been a couple weeks since my last post, and I've gotten some work in since then. I've gone through a short <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html">pandas primer</a>, but after quickly looking through it I have (fortunately) learned that there's still much to learn about using python and the different methods to do everything. I suspect my stubbornness stems from my usage of lower level languages in the past few years, which has almost exclusively consisted of C/C++ with a little Java sprinkled in, and frankly speaking I could do the analysis of the data (from the previous post) in these languages - but that would pass up a perfectly good learning opportunity to teach myself lots of things, namely, not to reinvent the wheel. 
				</p>

					I love writing my own little projects and have a lot of fun with them. After all, one look at my <a href="https://github.com/jorjiiie">github</a> shows a multitude of projects that certainly are technically interesting, and was the product of me wanting to explore. I think thats something I do very well, which is having a drive to be "indpendent" and want to thoroughly understand things before letting the levels of abstraction do their thing. After all, libraries and frameworks change, but the underlying concepts never do, so I figure learning it from scratch will be the better long term investment. In itself, this is not a problem, but the problem comes from trying to find the optimal way to use my time, and it's not a new thing to me. In the past I've had a little issue of spending more time thinking about <em> what</em> to do rather than just doing it, a little bit of all bark no bite and I definitely still see it happening a lot in my life today. Recently, I've found that it's similar to (if not essentially) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis"> analysis paralysis</a>, and to say the least it's a little comforting to know the chronic overthinking I endure is not unique to myself. That being said, it is my no means an excuse to continue this kind of behavior, so during this summer I hope to get a little more action done, even if it may not be the most interesting or "best" use of my time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But enough about that. I have a lot of thoughts, but I'd like to keep this tech-related. On that note, I've begun paying a little more attention to software & tech news, by reading news sites such as <a href="https://lobste.rs"> Lobsters</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com"> Hacker News </a> which have proved to be very interesting already. If anyone has any suggestions for other news sites (I also like reading career blogs, as someone who is planning on entering the software industry in a few years), please feel free to contact me about them! That'll be all for today, and it's very substance free, I know - fluffy as a unicorn :). I'll have some more work done next time, so look forwards to an analysis of the cost of MassSave throughout the years!
